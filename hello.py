  This diary app has three functions.
   - Write a diary: \n
   Let's record what happened in the day and end the day in a good mood!

   - Chatbot: \n
   Tell me about your frustrating concerns that you can't tell anyone easily. I have a chatbot on your side!

   - To-do : \n
   Let's organize what we have to do today and write it down! Plan your day!
